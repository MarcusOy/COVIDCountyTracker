# COVIDCountyTracker

A very basic COVID tracking script I made months ago using data from [CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports) to get cases and deaths for a particular US county.

Try it [here](https://marcusoy.github.io/COVIDCountyTracker/index.html) and see if it still works :)
